As a coding boot camp instructor at The Tech Academy, I create this project to use in a series of tutorial videos to teach students how to use Bootstrap. 

This series covered order of importance, how to override bootstrap styling with custom styling, the use of bootstrap layouts (containers, columns, and rows), and layout styling. 

I started by just covering HTML and CSS, then added JQuery to create a shrink on scroll effect of the nav bar and to collapse the navbar when a nav item has been clicked on mobile screens- the challenge with this was to prevent it from closing when a sub menu was open to display more menu options. Then added Bootstrap JavaScript Popovers and Toast. The Popover is used to display the star rating of each movie on hover and the Toast was used to display the ticket information selection after a user pressed purchase tickets.
